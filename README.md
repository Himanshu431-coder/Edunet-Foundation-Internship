# Indian Agriculture Analysis Dashboard Using Power BI

## Project Overview
This project involves creating a comprehensive dashboard to analyze and visualize the state of agriculture in India. The dashboard, built using Power BI, focuses on providing insights into various agricultural metrics, including crop production, weather patterns, and economic factors affecting Indian farming.

## Key Features
- **Agriculture Data Visualization**: A detailed interactive dashboard showcasing key agricultural statistics across India.
- **Regional Analysis**: Allows users to filter data based on regions and states to gain insights into localized agricultural performance.
- **Economic Factors**: Includes analysis of economic factors like market prices, crop yields, and government schemes.
- **Weather Insights**: Visualization of weather data impacts on agriculture productivity.

## Technologies Used
- **Power BI**  
- **Data Modeling**  
- **DAX (Data Analysis Expressions)**  
- **Power Query Editor**  

## Internship Mentor
This project was carried out under the mentorship of **Mr. Chaitanya Sathe**, whose guidance was invaluable in understanding the intricacies of agricultural data analysis and data visualization using Power BI. His teaching emphasized the importance of creating insightful and interactive dashboards to drive data-driven decision-making.

## What I Learned from This Internship
During this internship, I learned how to leverage Power BI to clean, model, and visualize data effectively. I gained hands-on experience in creating interactive dashboards that allow users to explore data in-depth. I also learned to use DAX for calculations and Power Query for data transformation, which enhanced my understanding of data analysis workflows. Furthermore, I gained a deeper understanding of the agricultural sector in India and how data-driven insights can support decision-making in farming and policy development.
