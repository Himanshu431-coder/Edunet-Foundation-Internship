# AI/ML-Driven Analysis of the Indian Agriculture Sector: Power BI and Advanced Analytics

## Project Overview
This project is a hybrid data analytics and machine learning application focused on the Indian agriculture sector. It combines the power of **Power BI for interactive dashboards** with **Python-based machine learning** models to deliver insights into **crop yield prediction**, **climate impact**, **resource allocation**, and more.
The aim is to help **farmers, researchers, and policymakers** make data-driven decisions to boost agricultural productivity and sustainability.

## Key Features
### ðŸ“Š Power BI Dashboard
- **Agriculture Data Visualization**: A detailed interactive dashboard with insights on crop production, weather patterns, soil nutrients, and regional analysis.
- **Economic Insights**: Analyze market trends, pricing, government schemes, and subsidies.
- **Weather Data Integration**: Visualize how rainfall and temperature impact productivity across regions.

### ðŸ¤– Machine Learning Models (Python)
- **Crop Yield Prediction** using regression models.
- **Risk Analysis & Clustering** for crop types based on region, nutrient levels (N, P, K), and climate data.
- **Visualization** of correlations using Matplotlib and Seaborn.
- Built in **Jupyter Notebook (.ipynb)** for full transparency and reproducibility.

## Internship Mentor
This project was carried out under the mentorship of **Mr. Chaitanya Sathe**, whose guidance was invaluable in understanding the intricacies of agricultural data analysis, AI and ML and data visualization using Power BI. His teaching emphasized the importance of creating insightful and interactive dashboards to drive data-driven decision-making.

## What I Learned from This Internship
During this internship, I learned 
Developing predictive models for crop yield estimation with high accuracy, enabling better planning of agricultural activities.

Creating dynamic dashboards to help stakeholders visualize regional nutrient deficiencies, climate risks, and performance metrics of different crops.

Improved understanding of the relationship between environmental factors and crop output, aiding in resource allocation and policymaking.

Gained hands-on experience in end-to-end AI/ML workflows, enhancing my technical proficiency and real-world problem-solving skills.
